This project aim to provide Christian ebook collection for everyone, every device.

## Instructions

To run this application on your machine, first clone the repository and install
the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SafeStudio/christian-ebook-collection.git
cd christian-ebook-collection

```

Run the `dev` script to compile the content and spawn a local server to serve
the compiled code. While this script is running, any changes made to the
markdown files will automatically be updated on the locally served pages.

```bash
yarn dev
```

the application in production mode. This will generate a directory in
`content/.vuepress` called `dist`.

```bash
yarn install -g serve
yarn build
cd content/.vuepress/dist
serve .
```
